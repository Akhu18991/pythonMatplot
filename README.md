# pythonMatplot
I have created a small script which creates Heart shaped plot.

Used matplot lib.
for installation we can use - 
                    1. python -m pip install -U pip setuptools
                    2. python -m pip install matplotlib
Matplot lib contains several packages like - numpy, six, python-dateutil, pyparsing, pytz, cycler and matplotlib.
